    "Q1. Elastic Net Regression and its Differences:\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. It introduces both penalties in the loss function to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection. It differs from other regression techniques, such as Ridge and Lasso, by including both penalty terms."

    "Q2. Choosing Optimal Regularization Parameters:\n",
    "The optimal values for the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) in Elastic Net Regression are often chosen using techniques like cross-validation. Grid search or randomized search can be employed to test a range of values for alpha and l1_ratio and select the combination that results in the best model performance."
